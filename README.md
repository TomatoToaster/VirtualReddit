A way to browse Reddit in VR using [React360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/)

## Getting started
1. Register a developer app with reddit [more details here](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/oauth2)
2. Then copy the contents of configTemplate folder to a folder called config and replace the values in the `apiKeys.js` file
3. Then install node and npm (if you don't have it)
4. Open this directory in a terminal and then run...
    * npm install
    * npm start
